/*  Note: mapStateToProps is where you should use `reselect` to create selectors, ie:

 import { createSelector } from 'reselect'
 const counter = (state) => state.counter
 const tripleCount = createSelector(counter, (count) => count * 3)
 const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
 counter: tripleCount(state)
 })

 Selectors can compute derived data, allowing Redux to store the minimal possible state.
 Selectors are efficient. A selector is not recomputed unless one of its arguments change.
 Selectors are composable. They can be used as input to other selectors.
