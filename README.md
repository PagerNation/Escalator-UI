## What is this?

This is the web UI for the Escalator Paging system. The UI is intended to interact
directly with the Escalator API. This UI primarily runs off of React and Redux.

### Note

We recommend getting the API setup first. This can be found
[here](https://github.com/PagerNation/Escalator-API).

## Starting

To run the server, first ensure that you're running at least Node version 6.7
and npm 3.10.

First install all dependencies with `npm install`.

To run the server, run `npm start`, the server will now be running on
`localhost:4000`.

## Testing

The current tests user Jest and are just basic snapshot tests.

To run the tests, run `npm run test`. 

To update outdated snapshot tests, run `npm run test:update`.
